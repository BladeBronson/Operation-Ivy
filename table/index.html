		<p>Here comes a table</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>This is a paragraph in a table. It is also editable because it is within the contenteditable area</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>You should be able to copy the contents of these cells...</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>But with a little JavaScript magic...</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>You should not be able to select across cells.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					The reason is that we want to treat tables like objects. The contents should be able to be edited, etc
				</td>
				<td>
					But parts of the structure shouldn't be able to be copied to the clipboard.
